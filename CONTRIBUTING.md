## Code changes

I will accept only pull requests that are related to issues that have been assigned to you. Unplanned and unexpected pull requests will be rejected.

This might seem draconian, but my goal is to save folks from spending weeks of their personal time on changes that will -- for one reason or another -- never be pulled. Been there, done that, and it ain't fun for anyone.

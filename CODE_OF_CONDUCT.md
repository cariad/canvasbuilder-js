# Code of Conduct

_TL;DR: don't be a dick._

Any contributions (including, but not limited to, code, bug reports and feature requests) that discriminate, mock or harass on the basis of age, body size, disability (either visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity/expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, colour, religion or sexual identity/orientation will be reported and removed.

To report a contribution that violates our code of conduct, contact [Cariad Eccleston](mailto:cariad@cariad.earth). Reports will be forwarded to service providers as-needed (for example, to forward an abuse report to GitHub's support team), but will otherwise be treated as confidential.
